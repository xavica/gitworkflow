CASPER JS

 Loading Lodash
-----------------------

C:\Users\GAYATRI>npm install lodash
lodash@3.9.3 node_modules\lodash // Msg u get back after installation.

var _ = require('lodash'); 
//include the above line in casperjs prog, and we can use lodash. but lodash will be loaded only in npm environment, 
so u have to run your casperjs programs in Nodejs environment.


 Regarding "Evaluate" Method:
 ___________________________

1. It does't accept forEach Method, it will iterate the loop but will not execute statements inside.
2. It does't work for the string function "startsWith()"
