		<h1>Red Abby Resort</h1>
	<p>I used to go to Grand Geneva Hotel. This time I decided to try the Abbey Resort and I was impressed with all the nice details that perhaps your do not notice when you first walk in the front door. Its a subtle classy place with everything you need for a nice break, very attentive staffs. The Avanti Spa is really nice, the atrium pool is quite, relaxing and soothing. The workout room with all the up to date machines was impressive. Not too big, just enough!! Both restaurant served good food and nice varieties. I especially liked all the activities they have planned for the guess and kids. My family and I had a great game of ping-pong with ice cream social. A great movie nite or hands-on paint art projects and all the games they lay out for the kids to play (No electronics was a breath of fresh air for the kids) and its away from the adult who wants quite times. Well thought out thus a thoughtful hotel!! Keep up the good work. Oh and needless to say the surrounding is just surreal!!!
